# RDR-Switch-Mod-Menu
This is the source code to the mod menu I have released for nintendo switch.
At this time of writing, the menu source code and compiled code is only usable on emulators such as yuzu and ryujinx, even tho yuzu is more compatible.
Slluxx created a real hardware script loader that allows this code work on real hardware for the most part, however I do not currently have permission to release or link to that.
So as such, real hardware is not yet supported however I will edit the code as needed/seen fit for real hardware compatibility for the case of it someday being released.
The Switch script compiler is a modified version of SC-CL by ImFoxxyyy which at this time of writing is closed source(switch version of sc-cl), I have permission from foxxyyy to release that compiler along side this source code for people to compile this project. You are granted permission to use that compiler for your own switch script needs.
You can use the code from this menu for your own projects, all I ask is that you give credits to everybody in the credits section. Feel free to optimize, bug fix, add features and do a pull/merge/update request. If a request is accepted you will get a honorable mention in the credits. If you change stuff, showcase the menu on webpost, videos, etc. You must bare minimum add all credits from the below.

# Disclaimer
For T2 & R* & DE: No original game files are included and I do not condone piracy, everybody should know exactly how to obtain a game backup from there own switch. I will not link or share methods or means on how to get games as that is illegal and I myself do not support such antics. This menu is made strictly for singleplayer and nothing more. If multiplayer support is ever added, I do not condone the use of this menu in multiplayer. The menu code is publicly available so as is, the code is at your disposal to patch it out from running on later updates.

For People Using The Menu: I am not responsible for any savegame progression loss, or the loss of any rpf's. By using this menu you fully accept that you know to backup your files before ever modding a game in general. If real hardware support is ever included and if this game ever receives multiplayer support (rather that be by official devs or emu devs or fanmade servers)
by using this menu you agree to never use it online to get a advantage over others. If you do or try to, you accept that you could get banned rather that be system banned, server banned, profile banned etc, that this falls all on you and that I personally take no blame for your actions. This menu was made to be used only in singleplayer and nothing more. You have been warned.
