This is a Add-On Menu for silent virtues. It's to be launched and loaded with the normal script loader in the menu.
It contains the cutscene player which was re-worked and moved here and removed from the main mod menu.
I ran out of script space in the main mod menu hence why a add-on menu was created.

The cutscene player now goes off cutscene/cutscene part names as well as index id's. 
I need help mapping out the cutscenes which is why I have a index id as well as cutscene names now.
The cutscene list will eventually be re-ordered once they are all mapped out.

The object spawner is very barebones. I need help with a rotation system because the math and functionality there is beyond me. If you have experience with
this for other rage engine script projects I could honestly use your help here.

CUTSCENES INFORMATION
-----------------------------------
Here is the current mapped out cutscenes/cutscene parts.
Where it says say 0-4 as example, the numbers are the "current" index id's that point to the current cutscene part.
These will re-ordered as they are mapped out so the index id's will change in the future once mapped out.

NORMAL STORY

0-302 is all normal story cutscene parts.

This is Armadillo, USA = 9-11<br>
